NCRC-client

This is a simple wrapper script that will be used to enable the use of a two-factor authentication
mechanism for downloading NCRC controlled codes through the popular "Conda" distribution mechanism.

# NCRC Client

The NCRC client allows users to search, and install Conda packages contained behind an RSA protected
server.

## Install NCRC

The NCRC client is available via INL's public Conda channel repository or from the Anaconda Idaholab
channel.

INL Conda Repository:
```bash
$> conda install ncrc --channel https://conda.software.inl.gov/public
```

## Install an NCRC Application

```bash
$> ncrc install bison
Username: johndoe
PIN+TOKEN:
Solving requirements for bison...
```

Once finished, follow the on-screen instructions:
```bash
$> conda activate bison
$> bison-opt --version
<version is displayed>
```
> [!NOTE]
> The first time you run the application after installation, the application may appear to hang.
> Consecutive runs will not be hindered.

### NCRC Syntax

```pre
usage: ncrc [-h] {install,remove,search,list} ...

Manage NCRC packages

positional arguments:
  {install,remove,search,list}
                        Available Commands.
    install             Install application
    remove              Prints information on how to remove application
    search              Perform a regular expression search for an NCRC
                        application
    list                List all available NCRC applications

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

### NCRC Examples Usages

```bash
$> ncrc list
# Use 'ncrc search name-of-application' to list more detail
# NCRC applications available:

	sockeye
	direwolf
	griffin
	pronghorn
	relap7
	bison
	bluecrab
	marmot
	sabertooth
```
List all available NCRC applications

```bash
$> ncrc search griffin
Loading channels: done
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
... <trimmed>
ncrc-griffin              2024_09_30         build_0  ncrc-applications
ncrc-griffin              2024_10_11         build_0  ncrc-applications

Note: Only the last 90 days worth of packages are available. Older
      packages can be made available upon request.
      https://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/inl/applications.html
```
Lists all available versions of griffin

```bash
$> ncrc install griffin=2024_09_30

Downloading ncrc-griffin-2024_10_11-build_0.tar.bz2...

# after installation completes
$> conda activate griffin
$> griffin-opt --version
<the version is displayed>
```
Installing a specific version.

```bash
$> ncrc remove bison
 Due to the way ncrc wraps itself into conda commands, it is best to
 remove the environment in which the application is installed. Begin
 by deactivating the application environment and then remove it:
	conda deactivate
	conda env remove -n bison
```

The NCRC script being a wrapper tool, is unable to perform such a function. The user must deactivate
the environment and remove that environment using the appropraite conda commands.

## Troubleshooting

The occasional download failure is usually a victim of circumstance. Where the only solution is to
"try again". If the issue persists, check with our Discussions group for any known outages:
https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions/28494. If there are none, feel free to create a new
discusion to report any failures.

If you receive invalid credentials, you'll want to head on over to the NCRC page for contacting
help: https://inl.gov/ncrc/ (Make/Manage Requests, contact information will be listed on the left).

If you are running into a `command not found` error, chances are, you not operating within the
Conda environment for which you installed the NCRC client. Be sure you installed the client into
your (base) environment, or that you are in the (base) environment while attempting to invoke
`ncrc`:

```bash
$> conda activate base
$> ncrc --help
```
